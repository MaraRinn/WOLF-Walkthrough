# WOLF Walkthrough

WOLF is a KSP industry system that expands on MKS by adding industrial capacity without increasing part count. One of the problems with MKS that any significant industry results in an extremely large part count, which means save files are large and the game gets very slow any time an industrial system is loaded into physics range. WOLF addresses this by abstracting away the parts into a set of numbers reflecting the production capacity of each biome on a world.

This project is a walkthrough of the entire WOLF system including:

+ Resource discovery
+ Resource extraction and processing
+ Cargo transport routes
+ Passenger transport routes
+ Moving WOLF resources to the MKS system

The walkthrough includes step by step instructions and prepared craft.
